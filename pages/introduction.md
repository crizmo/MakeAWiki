## Introduction to KPM

KPM (Kindle Package Manager) is a package manager specifically designed for Amazon Kindle devices. It provides a simple and efficient way to install, update, and manage software packages on your jailbroken Kindle device.

### Features

### Why Use KPM?

Managing software on Kindle devices can be challenging due to the limited tools available. KPM simplifies this process by providing a standard way to install and manage software, similar to package managers like apt, yum, or brew that you might be familiar with from other systems.

KPM makes it easy to:

1. Discover available software
2. Install applications without manual downloading and extracting
3. Keep your applications updated
4. Remove applications cleanly when they're no longer needed
5. Share your own software with other Kindle users

### System Requirements

- A jailbroken Kindle device
- KTerm (Terminal emulator for Kindle)
- Basic network connectivity
- Approximately 2MB of storage space for KPM itself
